# 🎥 Video Classification with 3D CNN

This project demonstrates how to build an **automated video classification system** using **3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs)**. Unlike traditional image classification, video classification requires understanding both **spatial information (frame-level details)** and **temporal dynamics (motion across frames)**.

By preprocessing raw video data into structured inputs and training a 3D CNN, this project enables a computer to **analyze videos and predict the action or gesture being performed**.

## 📌 Project Overview

1. **Data Preparation**

   * Load raw video datasets.
   * Break each video into a sequence of frames (images).
   * Clean and preprocess frames (resizing, normalization).
   * Group frames into batches for efficient training.

2. **Model Architecture – 3D CNN**

   * Unlike standard 2D CNNs, a **3D CNN processes multiple consecutive frames together**.
   * Captures **spatial features** (objects, textures, colors) and **temporal changes** (motion between frames).
   * Learns high-level representations that enable classification of different video categories.

3. **Training Pipeline**

   * Input: batches of preprocessed video frames.
   * Optimization: loss minimization using backpropagation.
   * Regularization strategies (dropout, data augmentation) to reduce overfitting.
   * Learning rate scheduling for stable convergence.

4. **Prediction**

   * The trained model takes an unseen video as input.
   * Outputs the **most probable action/gesture class** the video belongs to.

Would you like me to also add a **sample code snippet** (like preprocessing + model definition + training loop) inside this README so that it looks even more practical for GitHub/portfolio?
